Going goth need not be restricted to Halloween parties but can be an ideal look to try out for the weekend. With Hollywood flicks like the Twilight series becoming a rage, everyone wants to add some element of mystery to their ensemble.Grease upMake-up is a key element to this look.Think dark smoky eyes, lots of black colour and prominent make-up. There’s nothing sexier than eyes that draw attention. A rich dark liner is a must. Start with lining your upper and lower rims with a thick line of black or deep grey pencil. You could opt for deep plums or grey-blue. You can extend the line a little beyond your eye corner for the cat-eye look. Next, fill in the eyeshadow. You could use greys and silver for a different look, otherwise stick to black. Layer a dual tone if you like, but remember to blend well. Finish off with two-three coats of mascara and a top coat of liquid eyeliner. Since the focus should be on the eyes, it’s best to go slow elsewhere. Just use a concealer and compact powder for the face. Lips can be either plain or deep red or brown. Just remember to keep it minimal. Add a glam touch with some glitter. Use a shimmer colour above the eyes or even a highlighter for that polished look.All wrapped upClothes should give a dark, evening feel. It’s time to get out the velvet, leather and lace in darker shades like black, purple and royal blue. Crimson red can also be used. Tight body hugging silhouettes like corsets are ideal. Think of that little black dress in leather, fitted leggings or net stockings and big boots. Accessories can be in the form of chains, belts, studded bracelets, skull pendants and spiked cuffs. Dark and edgy is what you should look like. So experiment with different garments, hair styles and make-up to create your perfect look.

There are certain qualities inmenthatwomenabsolutely dig. We tell you more...It’s not just about being talk, dark and handsome, there are certain ‘manly’ qualities about guys that can make any woman go weak in the knees. And while you may think it’s all about the looks, guess what? There’s more. It’s a potent mix of both, physical attributes and of course, that all important emotional touch.Here we tell you about six points you need to heed.Well groomed:Yes, we said tall but the reality is that height is really not as important a factor as how you present yourself to us is. Just like guys like a women who is well turned out, women too dig guys who ensure that they are perfectly groomed a la Leonardo DiCaprio. The basic funda we believe in is that if you are careful enough to take care of your self, we can trust you to take care of us. So remember guys, sloppy dressing, uncombed hair, dirty nails, smelly socks, stained shirts or jeans and the likes are an absolute no when you are trying to make that all important impression on someone from the fairer sex.Asense of style:We’d rather have you splurging on us than on obscenely priced designer wear. So, even if it’s a typical raste ka maal style that you swear by, make sure you adopt a certain classy and stylised look and maintain it. We’re not really asking you to be a picture copy of a Pierce Brosnan or a David Beckham, but trying to imitate their stylish will sure up your popularity quotient among the ladies. Keep yourself updated on the latest trends. Also, just as you have your reservations against the ‘nun-type’ dressers, we women too hesitate when it comes to the boring office type dresser.Laugh it out:One of the most important trait that woman dig is a sense of humour. We have more than enough problems to deal with and we don’t really need the company of another equally depressed soul. Yes, you have your bad days, but it does go a long way if you have a good sense of humour, and clean humour at that. Beware, taking a dig at others and constantly putting others down does not really spell fun for us. And we can’t tell you enough how much we love people who can laugh at themselves and their own mistakes.Show us you care:Women need to be constantly reassured that they are loved and cared about. Holding our hand while walking down the road or watching the sunset, an occasional hug and peck on the cheeks, making sure that we cross the road safely, etc means that you are proud to be seen with us and care. Remember, not displaying your affection openly is a sign that you are ashamed of who you are with. However, beware of being crass while displaying you affections.A sexy smile/wink:There’s a reason why women absolutely adore a Richard Gere or Hugh Jackman and it has a lot to do with the way that they smile or that glint in their eyes. Believe us when we tell you that if you look at us and smile like that, it does make us feel very special, like we are one in a million.Be calm:Woman are known to be harrowed and frenzied. Yes, we do tend to get hyper very easily and that is the precise reason why we need you to be thecalmingfactor in our lives. It really doesn’t help if you too get stressed out or fly off the handle at any and every incident. Your sex appeal lies as much in your looks as it does in your attitude — we dig guy with a cool and peaceful attitude, the one who is able to calm us down and reassure us that all is well.","How manly are you

Using alubricantduring sexual activity alone or with apartnercontributes to more pleasurable and satisfyingsex, a new study has found.The Centre for Sexual Health Promotion (CSHP), Indiana University (I-U), studied 2,453 women aged between 18 and 68.Participants strongly endorsed that lubricant use improved their sexual experiences in more than 70 per cent of the events.Women indicated that using lubricants made sex feel very pleasurable and more comfortable.Personal lubricants have long been recommended to women to improve the comfort of sexual intercourse and to reduce the risk of vaginal tearing, yet strikingly little data is available on women's use of lubricants or associated vaginal symptoms.The study, conducted by Debby Herbenick, associate director of CSHP, involved women who used one of six different water or silicone-based lubricants.The study also found that side-effects were rarely associated with lubricant use; vaginal tearing occurred during less than one percent of vaginal intercourse and genital pain was reported in less than five percent of intercourse.The CSHP study examined their use of water-based or silicone-based lubricants during sexual activity.The use of lubricants during sexual activity has been recommended as a strategy to reduce the likelihood of vaginal tearing, which can increase risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.The women in the study primarily were heterosexual (85.6 per cent) and married (56.4 per cent), with an average age of 32.5, says a CSHP release.Another CSHP study involving 1,834 men examined the use of lubricants during vaginal intercourse. The study involved 8,876 coital events, 46.8 per cent of which involved the use of a latex condom and 24.7 per cent of which involved the use of a lubricant.These findings were presented at theInnovative Research on Sexual Health session.Massage, the best foreplay?","","National News","08/01/2011"

Jennifer Lopez’slovemight not cost a thing, but then again, she’s a celebrity. For the rest of us mere mortals, there is a price put on the love that we give or receive. And if the results of a survey conducted by a well-known international university are to believed, then the price of falling in love, on an average, is two of your closestpals.The research goes on to explain that when you embark on a new romantic relationship, you tend to break-up with, on an average, two of your closest pals.Why? Well, for the simple reason that most of us are so enamoured with our love for that special someone in our lives that we don’t take time out for our friends.“When you begin to spend more time with that special someone, you tend to put everyone else on the backburner,” says Bhuvanesh Bhatt, a medical student who has been in a steady relationship for over a year. “Guys nights-out, those endless cans of beers on the couch, while watching action flicks — everything becomes a distant memory. To make matters worse, you tend to ignore your female friends, fearing that your girlfriend might become jealous. Over time, your life becomes all about your romantic interest and that’s the end of it,” he exclaims.Bhuvanesh is definitely not exaggerating. When it comes to mingling with each other’s friends’ circle, things can get a bit daunting. Different temperaments, ego problems and a host of complaints like ‘you spend all your time with your friends’ and ‘you have no time for me’, begin to surface in the relationship. Adds Natasha Rao, a media professional says, “That you lose two of your closest friends is taking it a bit too far, but there is an ounce of truth to the study, especially when the romantic liaison is fresh. I know several people who would pooh-pooh the idea, but then, that’s reality, whether they like it or not.” She also feels that a new romance is not a good enough reason to ditch a friend who has stuck by you through thick and thin. “A balance is required, no matter how exciting the new person in your life maybe. People should understand that everything requires its own space — be it a new relationship or yourfriendshipwith your closest buddy,” she adds.Trouble is if your friends fail to understand your situation and feel slighted,” says student Veena Sugathan, adding, “After the initial courting period, most couples go back to spending time with friends as well, but what if your friends no longer want to spend time with you?”There are others though, like Ravi Ashokan, a software employee, who feels that you cannot put a price on love, even if it is two friends.“If a girl were to demand that much of my time, I would try make her understand that I need to have my space and a social life. If she can’t understand that, then well, it simply won’t work between us,” he opines. “There will be that one girl for whom I will be willing to throw everything away. I just haven’t met her yet. Until I do, it is definitely friends over girls for me,” he concludes.Follow us on Twitter for more stories","The cost of love

Does becoming a parent mean that your days of funsexare over? Why then is it tough for kids to face parental sex upfront? We have the answers...Being caught red-handed making out in front of your parents is every youngster's worst nightmare. But what if the tables are turned and you found yourself catching your parents in the act? Are parents engaging in public display of affection still a taboo for most young kids?Does sex take a backseat with kids around?Take a look around and you will soon realise that advertisements, novels and news instill a belief in us that love and affection is a property of the young and restless.And that sexuality should cease right after a woman's menopause. Sadly, in India most couples' sex lives take a beating after kids are born and in their formative years, parents put breaks on their libido.While most kids find it difficult to attune themselves to their parent���s natural sexual instincts, parents shy away from publicly displaying their affection towards each other. 25-year-old, software consultant Prashant Sharma confesses, ���My parents have always been the expressive kinds. They can often be seen sitting hand in hand at a gathering. But it was when I got married that I started to feel very awkward around them since they continued their old ways. Finally, I had to ask them to act a bit reserved in public.���To this psychologist Swati Arora advises, ""It's best to keep your intimacy behind the doors when your kids are around. Always keep the doors closed, else you could have a surprise visit. Also, planning couple holidays to beautiful locations gives couples a chance to enjoy intimate moments together without any awkwardness. This way they can be intimate, sans being explicit.""The Age MarkA lot of parents put a lid on their sex lives once they cross a certain age limit. But does physical craving have to do anything with biological age? Today, the reality is that sex is an important part of older people���s lives much more than it was a few years ago. Koyal Sinha, a 50-year-old housewife shares her experience. ���One of my very close friends who is doing well professionally once questioned me if it was okay for women of our age to feel attracted to someone physically. I was taken aback by the question, but yes it did make sense.���Earlier it was perceived that parents must just think about bringing up their kids and ensure a stable future for them. But the truth is that in today���s liberated society, we have more choices when it comes to sex andrelationships. Opines relationship expert Shikha Kapoor, ���Adults who are not exactly old fashioned and not completely modern find themselves stuck somewhere in between. And hence they try to make sense of the sexual rules that were set by their super elders.Legal consultant Lalit Kapur feels that age is no bar. He is a father of two grown up kids but that hasn't stopped him from enjoying every moment with his wife. He shares the secret, ""Though we do not get touchy feely in front of our kids, but that does not stop me from making my wife feel special in the presence of others. I keep on complimenting her looks, pampering her with gifts and while driving back home I surprise her with a phone call playing a song of dedication.""The Reality Of DivorceWith urban divorce rates at an all time high, we are seeing an increased sexual liberation amongst older men and women. Those who remarry at a later stage in life experience a new rush of emotions. But the kids find it difficult to acquaint themselves to this awakened sexual desire in their parents. Content writer Prachi Verma adds, ���When my mother remarried I was taken aback by my mom���s new avatar. She was all touchy feely with my stepdad. I used to resent it to no ends, but my friends helped me see logic.���56-year-old Sunita Dogra, a mother of two, who has recently re-married after her husband���s sudden demise a few years ago adds. ���I feel I am in love all over again, but no one around me seems to understand the feeling. My equation with my kids changed overnight when they heard of my decision. Like the old days, I feel an adrenaline rush similar to my younger days when I was married to my kids��� dad. I want to relish this experience, but there are bottlenecks. I am still struggling to make my son and daughter understand the new me and me needs.���Psychologist Sandeep Vohra adds, ���Getting a new life partner after experiencing a void makes the experience more cherishable. It���s like having a new life where you want to make up to all that you have been missing- which also means for many- kickstarting your sex life. Hence, the need for love, emotions and attraction in your partner plays a vital role. Hence, you see many new couples being pretty expressive emotionally and physically.���While kids are expected to observe rules when it comes to their sexual conduct in front of parents, are parents expected to do the same? The answer is 'yes.' With single parenthood being an urban reality, one of the most difficult situations for a kid is to see their single parent bring home a lover. ""Such a situation can have serious psychological disturbances in a kid's life. Infact, they grow highly insecure and are said to have turbulent relationships in their own future. So it's very important to first introduce your lover to your kids before just getting on with him. Involve your kids in the process of knowing the person and eventually reveal your feelings. Once you sense acceptance, that's a green signal.""Caught In The ActKids who walk in on their parents having sex are known to feel a sense of shame and insecurity. Psychologist Pradeep Mehra opines, ""Kids never imagine their parents as doing anything else apart from 'parenting.' So when they catch them in an uncompromising situation, it comes as a culture shock to them as they don't expect their parents to still have an active sex life. But it's best to be calm about it. There will be some awkwardness, but they will understand with time.""Follow us on Twitter for more stories","Caught your parents in the act?
